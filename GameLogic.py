"""@package docstring
GameLogic.py (or, MineSweeper.py) should deal with the handling of the game's
run time logic.

Question: Maybe both client AND server side logic should be handled here. Since
we're currently looking at three different game modes, we can throw all of our
logic here and then just have the three modes do everything on their own?

That way there's no need to worry about client/server stuff if you're in
single player mode
